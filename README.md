### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Passionate about technology and eager to learn, I'm currently immersing myself in the world of Python through a bootcamp program.
With a knack for problem-solving and a creative mindset, I'm on a mission to develop innovative software solutions that make a positive impact.
I'm interested in Data Engineering and Data Analysis.
